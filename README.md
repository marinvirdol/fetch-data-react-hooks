In this project I experiment with React hooks. More precisely, I want to fetch data in React with Hooks by using the state and effect hooks.

For this purpose I am going to use the [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to fetch popular articles from the tech world.

I will also implement a custom hookd fo the data fetching that can be reused anywhere in an application.
